### Day 2: January 23, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with python tutorials. 

**Thoughts** I learned about Variable Assignments, Strings, String Indexing and Slicing, String Properties and Methods. Mostly the bracket modified [], [:], [::].

### Day 3: January 24, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Python: Print formatting, lists, and dictionaries 

**Thoughts** I learned about print formatting. I also learned about lists and how they can be manipulated like strings with concatenations and slicing. I also learned about dictionaries and how they use a key-value pairing to allow users to quickly grab objects without needing an index location.

### Day 4: January 25, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Python: Tuples, Sets, Booleans, File I/O

**Thoughts** I leanred about how tuples are immutable, which is good when you need data to stay the same. I also learned about Sets, and Booleans. Lastly I went over File I/O. You have to remember to close the file, and what mode you want to use when reading or writing.
