# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 22, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I setup the Python Environment.

**Thoughts** I started onthe udemy complete course tutorial. So far it's good, learning basics about numbers.

### Day 2: January 23, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with python tutorials. 

**Thoughts** I learned about Variable Assignments, Strings, String Indexing and Slicing, String Properties and Methods. Mostly the bracket modified [], [:], [::].

### Day 3: January 24, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Python: Print formatting, lists, and dictionaries 

**Thoughts** I learned about print formatting. I also learned about lists and how they can be manipulated like strings with concatenations and slicing. I also learned about dictionaries and how they use a key-value pairing to allow users to quickly grab objects without needing an index location.

### Day 4: January 25, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Python: Tuples, Sets, Booleans, File I/O. Global Game Day 1

**Thoughts** I leanred about how tuples are immutable, which is good when you need data to stay the same. I also learned about Sets, and Booleans. Lastly I went over File I/O. You have to remember to close the file, and what mode you want to use when reading or writing.

Today, I started my entry to Global Game Jam. In our entry, you play as an interior designer with eccentric clients that have particular tastes. The clients ranged were fantasy characters like dragons, trolls, and princesses. We did the initial coding of the menus and how they would interact.

### Day 5: January 26, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Global Game Jam Day 2, the Game Manager

**Thoughts** I created a whole game manager that handled button clicking, stepping through the game, and processing of actions. We started getting feature creep in, and toward the end of the day, I almost scrapped everything we had to accommodate the newer features that we wanted.

### Day 6: January 27, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Global Gam Jam Day 3, Finishing up and cleaning up.

**Thoughts** Kat saved my ass and created an amazing playerInfo class that could store all the information we needed with the new features. With this player class we were back on track to implement the newest features such as specific traits each of the clients would have and how each item would be rolled with traits that the clients would like or hate. We submitted our game and code on time as well. Overall this game jame was hectic, but I learned a lot and would definitely do it again.

### Day 7: January 28, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Back to Python! Installed CV2 with Python 3.7 on Mac

**Thoughts** 
I setup CV2 with Python 3.7 on mac.

### Day 8: January 29, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: PortAudio and Pyaudio with Python 3.7 on Mac

**Thoughts** 
Setting up a dev environment on mac is much more unclear about how and where things are installing. It's confusing, should I be using sudo, brew, pip, pip3, conda? What is the best practice way? If I have already installed stuff, how do I uninstall and do it right?

### Day 9: January 30, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Installed Anaconda-Navigator, CV2

**Thoughts** 
Anaconda Navigator is much less confusing that using the terminal with brew and pip. Doing it this way makes it much easier to handle modules and packages because they are always installed in the correct folders. I am still having trouble getting CV2 to record higher than 5FPS and at different resolutions.

### Day 10: January 31, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: openCV

**Thoughts** 
I am learning the ins and outs with openCV. I have been able to record 10 second clips but only at 6FPS. The system already uses multi-threading, so I'm not sure how to increase FPS. Possibly add more threading cores, but I'm not sure how to split the frames to be processed and how to put the frames back together.

### Day 11: February 1, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: openCV

**Thoughts** 
More work trying to figure out OpenCV

### Day 12: February 2, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: openCV 30 fps

**Thoughts**
Got openCV to run multi-threaded and got above 30FPS

### Day 13: February 3, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Intro to GameDev

**Thoughts** 
Helped kids in Intro to Game Dev Class with Brian and Greg

### Day 14: February 4, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: openCV, Missing 'Shape'

**Thoughts** 
Learning about how to fix this problematic read error.

### Day 15: February 5, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: openCV, Video Recording, Video Playback

**Thoughts** 
I got video recording to work and video playback to work on separate scripts. I would like them to open full screen but I'm not sure how to do it yet. I also need to figure out how to call these scripts from a master script that is running all the time? I'm not sure.

### Day 16: February 6, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Three times the charm, event system

**Thoughts** 
Getting the menus in has been a nice change of pace from python.

### Day 17: February 7, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Three times the charm event system

**Thoughts** 


### Day 18: February 8, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: openCV, troubleshooting issues

**Thoughts**
OpenCV does not allow maximizing the stream session. You must record the stream at a set resolution. A physical workaround I am thinking of, is opening up the video in the center of the screen and we can size the physical hole for the display around that size. We can always scale a bit up or down to get higher resolutions or better performance.
